Basically did review today.  Worked on problems from the exam yesterday.
Felt I did alright.  The point of the exam was to gauge on where every-
body is at.  It definitely made me realize that I need more work on in-
heritance and string manipulation.

We also briefly went over visual studio because we will be starting C#
tomorrow.
