Started our big project Lemonade Stand. Got a method to return random 
weather.  Now I am trying to get that method to run in my day class since
each day has weather.  Haven't had any success yet.  Frustrating!

Once I get that figured out I will move onto to creating a customer object
which will need to have the probability of being thirsty in relation to the
weather.  ie...if its hot and sunny their chances of being thirsty and 
purchasing some lemonade will be higher, lower if it cooler outside.
