Today we worked on problems dealing with 2D arrays that dealt with nested
for loops, while loops that checked against an array verifying whether or not
an element already existed or not and destructors.  These tasks are very difficult
but are good practice. These tasks made it very obvious that I need to under-
stand the logic behind it all...

Also got feedback from my Robot project.  Actually did better than I expected
but there is always always room for improvement.  OOP is a love/hate relation-
ship.  There are a lot of cool things you can do with it but actually learning
how is the difficult part.  Difficult but so necessary.
