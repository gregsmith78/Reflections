Today we worked on our Dice Game.  Some of the struggles we are facing
are basically looping.  We are trying to get our game to repeat a set of
methods that we created i.e. until our array is full.  The array becomes
full when a character is built. A character is complete once the player
achieves a head, eyes, ears, body, arms, and legs. Once that is done the
game is over.
