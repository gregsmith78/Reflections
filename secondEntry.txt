Today we started the day off with a scrum.  Scrums are essentially a quick
meeting with the instructional staff to discuss what goals or tasks we have
learned the previous day and what our goals are for the day.  The purpose of
these meetings are to set goals and think about how to achieve them.

We also learned about networking technologies.  We briefly went into NAT-network
address translation, TCP, UDP, POP3, SMTP, as well as several others.  We talked
about ports and subnets.

We also learned about HTML and CSS.
