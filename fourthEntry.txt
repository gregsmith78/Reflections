Today we learned about Java.  We covered the fundamentals which would include
flow control with if/else statements and switch statements.  We had a couple
tasks that included determining an employee's wage for the week as well as
their overtime pay.  For our next task we needed to create an adventure story
applying what we have learned with flow control.
