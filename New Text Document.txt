Today we learned about binary code conversion to hexadecimal as well as octal conversion.
We learned about the general basics of what makes up a computer i.e. it's input devices,
output devices, and the cpu--the central processing unit.

We also learned about gitHub and it's core commands.  Such commands would be the git add,
git commit, git pull, and git push...and the git clone.  We also learned how to fix merge
conflicts.
